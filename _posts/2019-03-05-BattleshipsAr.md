A school project I made with two other students. The goal was to make a simple mobile AR application we decided to make it into a battleships inspired turn-based game. Main idea of the game was to be able to place a virtual game board on to a table and battle against friends online and locally using android devices.

The game was never finished and the turn-based multiplayer only worked locally by passing a single device between players. <!---Below is a sort video of early testing of placing down, moving, rotating and resizing the virtual game board.-->
