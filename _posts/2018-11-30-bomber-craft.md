A school project I made all by myself. Aim was to create a game inspired by one of six classic arcade games. I chose to make an online multiplayer Bomberman FPS game.

The core loop of the game is similar to the classic Bomberman but in order to use bombs player needs to mine resources from the walls of the cave. Due to the first-person perspective, lack of a map and the darkness the game feels scarier than ever before. Player has a flashlight which can be tactically toggled off in order to hide from other players. Listening for other players actions and looking for the beams of their flashlight is the key to stay ahead in BomberCraft.

I ended up spending most of my time trying to get the multiplayer aspects working and the game was never really finished but latest build is playable apart from couple multiplayer sync related bugs.
