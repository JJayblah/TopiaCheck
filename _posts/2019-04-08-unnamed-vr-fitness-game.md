A school project I worked on with the same two students as [BattleshipsAR]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-03-05-BattleshipsAr.md %}). Aim was to make a simple VR game.

We wanted to create a VR fitness game where you progress through the game following instructions from a series of fitness VHS tapes and by exploring and interacting with things in the room. Game was created for HTC Vive.

There really isn't much of a game here but several different interactable objects placed in a room for player to discover. 

Interactable objects inlude:
- Record player
- CRT TV with multiple channels
- TV power cord and plug (needs to be plugged in)
- Hidden safe (functional combination lock)
- Bouncy ball
- etc.
