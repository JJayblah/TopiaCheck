Multi school collaboration project I worked on with a team of seven for around three months. Our initial idea was to make a [Dead by Daylight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/) style game but using themes more suitable for younger audiences.

In the game player plays as a magpie tasked with recovering ten trinkets scattered across the map while avoiding a fox which patrols the area. Player may only carry three trinkets at the time and will lose them if caught by the fox. Magpie can't fly but can glide for long distances.
