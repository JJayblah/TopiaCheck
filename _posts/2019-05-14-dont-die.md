A school project I worked on in a team with three fellow programmers, two artists and a composer.

!DON'T DIE is a fun 3D puzzle platformer inspired by popular games at the time such as [Human Fall Flat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/477160/Human_Fall_Flat/) and [Gang Beasts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285900/Gang_Beasts/). Goal of the game is to be the first one to DIE in hilarious ways, whilst trying to prevent others from dying. The game has local splitscreen multiplayer and supports up to four players.
